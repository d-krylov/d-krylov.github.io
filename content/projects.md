### <a href="https://github.com/d-krylov/Algernon" target="_blank" class="icon is-large"><i class="fab fa-github href-icon-color"></i></a> Algernon - Geometry Processing Library

{{< imagetext src="/images/preview/terabithia.png">}}
Algernon is a concise C++ Geometry Processing Library focused on fundamental mesh manipulation and topological operations. It features mesh loading from standard formats like GLTF and OBJ, employs the half-edge data structure for efficient topology access, and includes algorithms such as Marching Cubes for surface reconstruction and Conway Polyhedron Operators for geometric transformations.

### <a href="https://github.com/d-krylov/Babylon" target="_blank" class="icon is-large"><i class="fab fa-github href-icon-color"></i></a> Babylon - Collection of shaders

{{< imagetext src="/images/preview/babylon.png">}}
Babylon is a collection of GLSL shaders specifically created to illustrate fundamental concepts and algorithms in computer graphics. The project serves as a focused, hands-on demonstration of various techniques, including the rendering of fractals, the visualization of L-systems, the procedural generation of terrains... These shaders are designed primarily for educational and algorithmic demonstration purposes rather than for high-polish artistic presentation.

### <a href="https://github.com/d-krylov/Yoth" target="_blank" class="icon is-large"><i class="fab fa-github href-icon-color"></i></a> Yoth - Linear Algebra Library

{{< imagetext src="/images/preview/mathematics.png">}}
Linear algebra library for C++. Yoth provides classes to work not only with vectors, but also with points and normals, providing behaviour specific to these types of objects. The library is based on code from the [pbrt](https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v4) project, adapted to C++23 standards with additional tools added.

### <a href="https://github.com/d-krylov/wolf" target="_blank" class="icon is-large"><i class="fab fa-github href-icon-color"></i></a> Wolf - Vulkan C++ wrapper generator

{{< imagetext src="/images/preview/vulkan.png">}}
Wolf is a custom C++ wrapper generator for Vulkan, developed as a concise and task-specific alternative to the standard, more verbose vulkan.hpp. The tool parses the official Vulkan XML specification and generates tailored C++ headers, allowing developers to create a highly optimized and simplified API layer that perfectly fits the requirements of their specific graphics projects.

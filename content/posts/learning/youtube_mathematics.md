The number of YouTube channels I’m subscribed to is so large that I decided to highlight the most interesting ones so I wouldn’t forget to watch them.
This selection is entirely dedicated to mathematics. Below is a list of channels with brief descriptions.

* [Michael Penn](https://www.youtube.com/@MichaelPennMath) - A variety of videos on different branches of mathematics, mostly problem walkthroughs. 

* [ICTP Mathematics](https://www.youtube.com/@ictpmathematics6835)

* [Richard E Borcherds](https://www.youtube.com/@richarde.borcherds7998) - Lecture courses on number theory, elliptic functions, analysis, topology,
algebra, algebraic geometry... by Richard Ewen Borcherds.

* [Jaymin Shah](https://www.youtube.com/@JPiMaths) - Many videos dedicated to Olympiad mathematics, puzzling integrals and series, number theory, geometry

* [qncubed3](https://www.youtube.com/@qncubed3) - Various videos about interesting integrals, complex analysis, linear algebra.
